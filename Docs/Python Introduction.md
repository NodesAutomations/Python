# Intro

- python is interpreter language which is different from c# complier language
- in compiler language you can’t run program until you solve all errors
- in interpreter language execution happen line by line so even if you have some errors in your program all the lines about errors will gets executed, program will stop when he finds error
- Python also has dynamic semantics which mean data types of each objects are decided on runtime
- This is also different from regular programming language like C# where we decide data type of objects in advance
