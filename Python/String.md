### Three ways to define strings
- single quoted strings 
```
`vivek`
``` 
- Double quoted strings 
```
"Vivek"
``` 
- Triple quoted strings  
```
```Vivek```
``` 
Benifit of this system is that you can use separate system depending on your string. If your string contain double quote then you can define string with single quote, if you string contain double and single quote both you can use triple quote.
