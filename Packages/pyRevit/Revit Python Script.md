Dynamo/Python/RevitAPI - Create Levels + Floor Plans + Sheets - Code

Continuing with the previous scripts, we add two more features, create Revit sheets [4] and place views on them [5]. The main idea is to develop an automated procedure to configure a Revit project based on levels and packages. The script will use the default title block and viewports.

[1] Create floor plan type for each package
[2] Create Revit levels
[3] Create Revit floor plans
[4] Create sheet
[5] Place views on sheets
